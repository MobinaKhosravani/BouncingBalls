# **Bouncing Ball Game (C++ & SDL2)**

A simple bouncing ball game built using **C++** and **SDL2**, demonstrating basic game loops, rendering, event handling, and simple physics.  
This project was created as part of a **basic programming course at Sharif University of Technology**, and helped me practice game development fundamentals and SDL-based graphics programming.

## 🚀 **Features**

- Smooth ball movement with basic physics  
- Collision detection with window boundaries  
- Adjustable ball speed and direction  
- Clean and structured C++ code using headers & implementation files  
- Uses SDL2 for graphics and event handling

## 🎯 **How It Works**

- The **Ball** class handles movement, bounce logic, and texture rendering.  
- The **Pos** class stores coordinates and velocity.  
- Custom **Renderer**, **Window**, and **Texture** classes wrap SDL2 functionality.  
- The **Handler** class updates game logic every frame.  
- `main.cpp` initializes SDL, loads textures, enters the main game loop, and renders each frame.
